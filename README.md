# Viridian Protocol

Viridian is a decentralized protocol that transforms environmental stewardship into a quantifiable, tradeable asset class through market-driven mechanisms, built on the Allo Protocol ecosystem.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Environmental Impact Markets

The protocol creates liquid markets for environmental assets by:
- Tokenizing verified ecosystem services and conservation outcomes
- Implementing specialized bonding curves that price environmental impact
- Providing automated market making for environmental assets
- Enabling efficient price discovery for ecological value

### 2. Prediction-Driven Validation

Project outcomes are validated through:
- Decentralized prediction markets for conservation milestones
- Stake-weighted voting on environmental claims
- Evidence-based verification of impact metrics
- Market-based assessment of project success probability

### 3. Retroactive Conservation Funding

The protocol creates sustainable funding through:
- Integration with Allo Protocol's registry and strategy contracts
- Trading fee distribution to verified conservation projects
- Impact-weighted reward allocation via Allo Capital pools
- Success-based multipliers for proven outcomes
